## Password Security Standards

All passwords are **randomly generated** with no discernible pattern:
- **Length:** 16-20 characters (exceeds industry standard of 12+)
- **Randomness:** Cryptographically random character selection
- **Complexity:** Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Special Characters:** Multiple symbols (@, #, $, !)
- **Format:** Completely random - no patterns or words
- **Entropy:** Maximum security through pure randomness
- **No Dictionary Words:** Immune to dictionary attacks

**Example:** `Kx9#mP2vL@nR8qT!` - completely random, no meaning

### Username Structure

Usernames follow a professional, hierarchical format:
- **Prefix:** `fiq-` (FulfillmentIQ identifier)
- **Role:** `fe`/`be`/`fs` (Frontend/Backend/Full-Stack)
- **Level:** `beginner`/`inter`/`expert`
- **Year:** `2024` (for credential rotation)
- **Format:** `fiq-{role}-{level}-{year}`
